# pokedex_React

## Hi!

this is a project built-in with ReactJs 18, I use the basis of React like Hooks, Functional Components and Dynamic Styling; 
	
In this case, I use the API of [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co) to create a functional Pokedex that provides sufficient information about all pokemon in existence, I plan to get this project more attention and eventually get it bigger and complex to learn more about React and his advance functions.

In the meantime, I hope this project can help you seek for you favourite pokemon.
